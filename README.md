### Introduction.
Hello and thank you for looking through the model compiled by me in order to to examine the number of daily covid cases using LSTM Model. In this Readme I will attempt to predict the movement of the number of daily cases of Covid-19 using the well-known model parameter which is long short-term memory networks (LSTM), together it will combine the network of Dense and Dropout layers. The model architecture is presented as per below. In addition, i provided the graph of prediction as per below. thank you. 

### The Model Architecture
